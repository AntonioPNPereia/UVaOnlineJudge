# UVa Online Judge

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from the UVa Online Judge platform. Each problem solution is implemented in Java, and accompanying each Java file is a PDF file with the problem statement.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific UVa problem number. Inside each folder, you'll find two files:

- `Solution.java`: Java file containing the solution code.
- `Problem.pdf`: PDF file with the detailed problem statement.

Below is a list of problems with direct links to their folders:
